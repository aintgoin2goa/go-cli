# go-cli
Learning golang but writing a tool to help me at work.  This contains some tools to help me with my day-to-day tasks and likely will be no use to you, sorry!

## Install

(I've never written a bash script to install before, may not actually work!)
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aintgoin2goa/go-cli/master/install.sh | bash
```
